# It exists because the frozen `jobs` CHECK requires every terminal Job to carry a non-null

# `tool_loop_limit` is the Run reaching a budget the Run itself snapshotted: the model-call budget

# internal classification, and D2's reasons (`denied_not_granted`, `denied_connection_disabled`,
# `denied_definition_changed`, and the rest) stay on the invocation row for internal audit rather
# than becoming a public, enumerable description of a user's own configuration.
#
# It covers every refusal that provably did not run: a tool that was never granted, a grant
# withdrawn or drifted between the two checks, a disabled or deleted connection, a definition that
# became unavailable, and the pre-dispatch calls that never became a row at all -- an unknown tool
# name, malformed arguments, and arguments a canonical schema rejected.
TOOL_DENIED = "tool_denied"
# Infrastructural closeout code for a Run that never reached the execution-start boundary and
# whose Job exhausted its claim budget to repeated Worker losses. It is not a provider error, a
# timeout, a cancellation, or a retry disposition: execution provably never began, so this code
# is what licenses the one `failed` Run shape that carries no `started_at`. The code itself is
# owned by the domain, because `Run` validation is what enforces the shape it licenses.

# The single authority for every persistable code and its static NervOS-owned message.
# The database bounds `error_code` only by length, so nothing in SQLite stops a raw exception
# string from being written as a code: the allowlist has to be enforced here, in code.
