"""Stage H4 sandbox application contracts (ADR 0035).

The application layer defines the frozen resource policy and the containment port; the
concrete OS adapters live in ``nervos_core.infrastructure.sandbox`` and are composed only
by the Worker. The policy is code-level, deliberately not environment configuration: two
Workers that disagreed about containment would raise it by divergence, the same reasoning
C6 applied to concurrency.

Honesty rules this module enforces by shape:

* :class:`ContainmentResult` states which tier was established; a degraded tier is
  disclosed in Run metadata rather than silently accepted;
* an unavailable platform raises :class:`ContainmentUnavailable` — the Worker refuses to
  run the package instead of running it unsandboxed;
* a macOS (or otherwise unsupported) host can never report success.
