"""Scheduler composition root.

This module wires exactly four things together: an engine, the trigger persistence that reads and
writes durable schedule state, the schedule evaluator, and the service that decides what to do
about each due schedule. It deliberately imports no model provider, no MCP package, no tool
registry and no execution service, because a scheduler that could reach any of those is a
scheduler whose job has quietly stopped being "decide when".

The schema expectation is declared **here**, locally, rather than imported from the Worker. Each
process states the revision it was built for; sharing one constant would mean a Worker released
ahead of the Scheduler could silently change what the Scheduler accepts.
